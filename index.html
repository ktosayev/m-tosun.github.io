				<h4>Mobilisation of SRV "GILAVAR"</h4>
				<p>M TOSUN LTD handled the full mobilisation and demobilisation (installation and removal of the wheelhouse) of the seismic research vessel "GILAVAR", including all main and auxiliary systems during its operation in the Caspian Sea at the turn of the 21st century.  Being a highly complex ship, the operation was equally complex.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="four columns">
				<img src="images/ham311.jpg">
				<h4>Mobilisation of TSHD "HAM 311"</h4>
				<p>M TOSUN LTD reinstalled the wheelhouse of the trailing suction hopper dredger (which weighed more than 80 tons) with the 600t crane vessel "GURBAN ABBASOV" and reconnected all the systems.  Various repairs and modifications were made and the 5-yearly class (Bureau Veritas) survey was also carried out simultaneously with the project.  M TOSUN LTD took care of the ship's repair and service needs for the following years.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="four columns">
				<img src="images/barge.jpg">
				<h4>Conversion and Upgrade of Barges</h4>
				<p>A total of four DNV-classed barges were converted (2 for BUE Kazakhstan, 2 for Caspian Mainport) to have additional storage tanks and cargo systems installed.  An extraordinary expert effort was invested into the project such that the whole project took only 3 months to deliver, 3 months ahead of schedule.
